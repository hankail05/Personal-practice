Q.

Explain why the structure of a quad tree does not depend on the order
in which items are inserted into it.

A.

When raeching a leaf, instead of passing through, the algorithm split
its block into four and reallocate it and an element to insert,
and the location of them is determined with their location value.
So the quad-tree structure is independent to the order of insertions.
