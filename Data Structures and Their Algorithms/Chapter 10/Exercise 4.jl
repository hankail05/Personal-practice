Q.

Suppose that, as suggested on page 349, we use the constant-space
scanning algorithm (Algorithm 4.8 on page 118) to mark list structure
that has no cycles but may have multiple paths to some cells. How
much time might it take to scan a structure composed of n cells, each
containing two pointer fields?

A.

2n-2
