Q.

a. Formally define, using tree terminology: X and Y are kth cousins, where k is a nonnegative integer.

b. Repeat part (a) for the notion of "kth cousins removed r" (for example, "second cousins twice removed").

c. Write an algorithm that takes as arguments the root of a tree and two nodes of that tree, and determines numbers k and r such that
the two nodes are kth cousins removed r.

A.

a.

If X and Y have different parent and are in the same depth, X and Y are kth cousins.

b.

If X and Y have different parent and are in the different depth, they are kth cousins removed r.

c.

function FindCousins(pointer root, X, Y): integer
{Find k and r when X and Y are kth cousins removed r}
    if Depth(X) <= Depth(Y) then
        r <- Depth(Y) - Depth(X)
	for i from 1 to r do
	    Parent(Y)
    else
        r <- Depth(X) - Depth(Y)
	for i from 1 to r do
	    Parent(X)
	    k <- 0
    if not IsSibling(root, X, Y) then
        while Parent(X) != Parent(Y)
	    X <- Parent(X)
	    Y <- Parent(Y)
	    k < k + 1
    return k, r

function IsSibling(pointer root, X, Y): boolean
{Check if X and Y are sibling}
    if root = nullptr then
        return false
    return (LeftChild(root) = X and RightChild(root) = Y) or
           (LeftChild(root) = Y and Rightchild(root) = X) or
	   IsSibling(Leftchild(root), X, Y) or
	   IsSibling(Rightchild(root), X, Y)
