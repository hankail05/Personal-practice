Q.

Susan decides to implement a queue of maximum length N in a table of size N by keeping track of the positions of the first and last elements of the queue,
rather than the position of the first element and the length of the queue; she figures this will save her some modular arithmetic and the code will be clearer.
Unfortunately, she can't seem to get her code to work; why not? What alternatives will work correctly?

A.

During en/dequepe operations, the queue 'moves backward.'
However, there is an end of the table so the queue have to go beyond the table someday, causing error like segmentation fault. We need to roll the queue.
The alternatives is a circular list, the first element comes after the last element.
But it also needs modulo arthmetic if she wants to implement an queue with the table. Sorry Susan.
