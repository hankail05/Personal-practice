Q.

A deque (pronounce "deck") or double-ended queue is a list abstract data type such that both additions and deletions can be made at both ends.
Present representations of deques in both contiguous and linked memory.

A.

In contiguous memory, the first and the nth pointers of deque will operate push/pop.
In linked memory, it should be implemented with a double linked list for deque(To be refered by those pointers). The other is same as the contiguous version.
