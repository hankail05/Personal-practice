Q.

Using abstract operations only, write a routine that takes as its argument a list of lists
and returns the concatenation of all the component lists.

A.

function ConcatAll(table list[0..n-1]): pointer
{Concatenate all lists in the table and return a pointer of the product}
    C <- list[0]
    for i from 1 to n-1 do
        C <- Concat(C,list[i])
    return C
