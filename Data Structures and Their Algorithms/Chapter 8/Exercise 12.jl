Q.

A binary trie is a trie with binary branching at depth k based on the
kth bit of the key. Instead of extending the tree to have height equal
to the number of bits in the longest key, a branch is terminated when
it corresponds to but a single key, and the key itself is stored in a leaf
node.

a. Construct a binary trie from the keys of Figure 8.4 on page 264.

b. Show that the structure of a binary trie is independent of the order
in which the keys are inserted.

c. Write the algorithm for binary trie insertion.

b.

Because of bit representations of each string is distinct (even permutations,) we can locate them in advance and the order doesn't matter.

function make_bitstring(S)
    B = ""
    for i in S
        B = string(B, bitstring(i)[4:8])
    end

    return B
end


function insert(S, T)
    p = T
    B = make_bitstring(S)

    for i = 1:length(B)
        if !(B[i] in keys(p))
            p[B[i]] = S
            return
        elseif isa(p[B[i]], String)
            S2 = p[B[i]]
            B2 = make_bitstring(S2)
            while B[i] == B2[i] && i < min(length(B), length(B2))
                p[B[i]] = Dict()
                p = p[B[i]]

                p["10"[B2[i]+1-'0']] = S # if a string is the prefix of the other..?
