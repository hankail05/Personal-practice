Q.

Let H be any set of functions from K to {O, ..., m-1}. Show that
there are distinct x,y ∈ K such that
|{h ∈ H: h(x) = h(y)}| / |H| > 1 / m - 1 / |K|.

A.

1/m - 1/|K| = (|K| - m) / m|K|, m|K| is the number of choosing an element from each set.
Because of pigeonhole principle, there must be collisions with K and {0, ..., m-1},
and |K|(|K|-1) - m is the number of collision, which is larger than |K| - m.
So there are dinstinct x,y ∈ K that satisfy the expression above.
