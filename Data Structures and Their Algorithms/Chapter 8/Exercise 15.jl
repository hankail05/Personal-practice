Q.

In ordered hashing with open addressing, is it true that the keys
encountered along the probe sequence of a key in the table are in
alphabetical order?

A.

Although the ordered hasing orders the sequence of elements, there are possibilities that a key probes on other keys without probing,
and then we cannot say that they are ordered.
ex) a-14 linear probing on z-14-1, c-15-1.
