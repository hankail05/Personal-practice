Q.

a. In which of the intervals of Figure 8.13 does the next value of
{Kϕ^(-1)} lie (the one for K = 11)?

b. Using standard 8-bit ASCII character codes and the 16-bit value
of σ shown in Figure 8.14, determine the 8-bit multiplicative hash
values of the keys AA, AB, and BA.

A.

a.

11*ϕ^(-1) mod 1 = 0.7983

b.

σ = 0.6605682373046875, AA to 10537, AB to 10538, BA to 10793.

AA => 01100111 = 103
AB => 00010000 = 32
BA => 10000010 = 130
