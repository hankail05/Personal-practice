Q.

Show the structure of the extendible hash table that would result in
the (unlikely) event that records with hash values 000, 001, 010, 011,
100, 101, 110, 111 were inserted into an initially empty hash table.

A.

Assume that b=2.

01-----2:000,001
01-----2:010,011
10-----2:100,101
11-----2:110,111
