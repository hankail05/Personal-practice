Q.

(This problem is one of psychology, not mathematics.) Suppose you
are given two dozen numbers on a piece of paper, and are asked to
produce-by hand-another piece of paper with the same numbers
in order. What sorting method would you use? Does your answer
change if there are five hundred numbers? What if there are five
thousand numbers, with five hundred on each of ten pieces of paper?

A.

However many numbers are, I scan them repedetly.
