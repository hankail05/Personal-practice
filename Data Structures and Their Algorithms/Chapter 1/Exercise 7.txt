Q.

a. Write a procedure Append that adds a new element to the end
of a linked list represented as in Figure 1.4 on page 6. The call
Append(K, list) should create a new record with key value K and
add it just after the last element in list. You may use the procedure
NewNode of Algorithm 1.4 on page 12, and use of a locative will
be handy.

b. Write the same procedure without locatives. Append should now
take only one argument, and may refer to list as a global variable
(in case list has no elements).

A.

a.

procedure Append(key K, locative list):
{Add a new element to the end of the linked list}
    while Next(list) != nullptr do
        list <- Next(list)
    Next(list) <= NewNode(K, nullptr)

b.

procedure Append(key K):
{Add a new element to the end of the linked list}
    P <- list
    while Next(P) != nullptr do
        P <- Next(P)
    Next(P) <- NewNode(K, nullptr)
