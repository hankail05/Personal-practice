Q.

There are two basic kinds of Froobs, fragrant and frumious. Fragrant
Froobs come in 35 varieties, each of which can be found in four
different colors; frumious Froobs come in another 17 varieties, each
of which can be found in fifteen different colors. Devise an encoding
of Froobs in as few bits as possible so that it is easy to tell, by
using ordinary computer operations, whether a Froob is fragrant or
frumious, and what its variety and color are.

A.

Set the first bit to tell whether a Froob is fragrant or frumious.
In fragrant, varieties need 35 patterns and colors need 4 patterns, so the possible patterns are 35x4=120.
Thus fragrant needs 8 bits, a bit for what kinds of a Froob is, and the rest bits for the patterns.
In frumious, varieties need 17 patterns and colors need 15 patterns, so the possible patterns are 17x15=255.
Thus frumious need 9 bits, a bit for what kinds of a Froob is, and the rest bits for the patterns.
For consistency, A Froob needs 9 bits.
