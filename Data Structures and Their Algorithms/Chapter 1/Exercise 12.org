Q.

Show that the relationship
$\lfloor \frac{\lfloor x/y \rfloor}{z} \rfloor = \lfloor \frac{\lfloor x/z \rfloor}{y} \rfloor$
does not always hold for real numbers $x$, $y$, and $z$, but that is does
hold for integers $x$, $y$, and $z$.

A.

If $y$ or $z$ are real number lower than 1,
$x/y$ and $x/z$ are greater than $x$, $y$, and $z$
which lead that the equation does not hold. (ex. 4 0.1 3)
Since fragment of $x/y$ and $x/z$ does not affect quotient of the result,
the order of division and flooring with integer variables doesn't matter.
