Q.

The table search in algorithm (A) terminates when either K is found
in the table or the end of the table is reached. Each of these conditions
must be checked every time around the loop. (In Algorithm 1.2 on
page 10, the more formal description of algorithm (A), the first test
is T[i] = K and the second test is implicit in the for loop, where we
must always check whether i < n - 1.) Find a simple improvement
to algorithm (A) that avoids testing whether the end of the table has
been reached. (You may assume that table position T[n] is available
for your use.)

A.

function SequentialSearch(table T[0..n], Key K): integer
{Return position of K in table T if it is, otherwise return -1. The nth element of table contains K.}
    i <- 0
    repeat forever
        if T[i] = K then
	    return (i + 1) % (n + 1) - 1
	else then
	    i <- i+1
