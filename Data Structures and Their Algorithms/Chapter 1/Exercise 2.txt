Q.

We said that algorithm (B) is slightly more intelligent than algorithm (A).
For exactly which words K does algorithm (B) compare fewer pairs of words than algorithm (A)?

A.

Suppose that the word K is not in the table T.
In algorithm (A), we should run algorithm until the end of table reaches.
But in algorithm (B), there are words which comes later than K in sorted table.
It this case, the algorithm (B) compares fewer pairs of words than (A).
