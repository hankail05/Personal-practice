Q.

A *Frob* is an object that is available in three different sizes, and has
front, middle, and back parts, each of which (independently) can be
painted any of ten colors, or can be left unpainted.

a. Design a record structure with four fields that can be used for
representing Frobs. What is the minimum number of bits for
each field, and for the entire record structure?

b. It is possible to represent a Frob uniquely by using only 12 bits.
Explain how to encode the size and three color values to produce
the encoded representation of a Frob, and how to decode the
representation of a Frob to extract its size and three color values.

A.

a.

To make each part painted any of ten color or not painted, we need at least 4 bits. To decide what size a Frob is, we need 2 bits.
So each field needs 4 bits and the entire size of Frob is 14 bits.

b.

Since a number of cases that the three fields are colored is 11^3=1331 and there are three different sizes,
The whole number of cases is 3993, which is lower than 2^12=4096.
So 12 bits are enough to represent a Frob.
