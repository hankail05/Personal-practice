Q.

Write a routine LLMember(K, P), which takes a key K and a linked
list P and returns true or false, depending on whether K is in the list.
You should assume that the list has been constructed using Algorithm 1.5 or 1.6,
so that the keys are in order in the list.

A.

function LLMember(key K, pointer P): boolean
    while P != nullptr and Key(P) â‰¤ K do
        if Key(P) = K then return true
    return false
