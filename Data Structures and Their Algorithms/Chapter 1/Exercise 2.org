Q.

We said that algorithm (B) is slightly more intelligent than
algorithm (A). For exactly which words $K$ does algorithm (B) compare
fewer pairs of words than algorithm (A)?

A.

Suppose that the word $K$ is not in the table $T$.
In algorithm (A), we should run algorithm until it reaches the end of the table.
But in algorithm (B), there can be words which come later than $K$ in a sorted table
that the algorithm (B) doesn't have to check them.
In this case, the algorithm (B) compares fewer pairs of words than (A).
