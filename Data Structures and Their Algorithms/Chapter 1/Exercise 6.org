Q.

Write the procedure $SinglyLinkedDelete$ that complements procedure
$SinglyLinkedlnsert$ of Algorithm 1.1 on page 8. It should take as its
argument a pointer $P$ and should delete the cell just after the one to
which $P$ points. Be sure to handle the possible error condition in
some appropriate way.

A.

#+BEGIN_SRC julia :kernel julia
  function SinglyLinkedDelete(P::LList)
      """
      Delete the cell after the one to which P points
      """
      if P.next != nothing
          P.next = P.next.next
      end
  end
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC julia :kernel julia
  include("SinglyLinkedList.jl")

  list = LList(1, nothing)
  SinglyLinkedInsert(LList(3, nothing), list)
  SinglyLinkedInsert(LList(2, nothing), list)
  list

  SinglyLinkedDelete(list)
  list
#+END_SRC
