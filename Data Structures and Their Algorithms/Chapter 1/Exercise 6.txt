Q.

Write the procedure SinglyLinkedDelete that complements procedure
SinglyLinkedlnsert of Algorithm 1.1 on page 8. It should take as its
argument a pointer P and should delete the cell just after the one to
which P points. Be sure to handle the possible error condition in
some appropriate way.

A.

procedure Singlylinkeddelete(pointer P):
{Delete the cell after the one to which P points}
    if Next(P) != nullptr then
        Next(P) <- Next(Next(P))
