Q.

Show that if m and n are integers and m != 0 then
ceiling(n/m) <= (n-1)/m + 1.
Under what conditions does equality hold? What if m or n is not an integer?

A.

ceiling(x) = floor(x) + 1 < x + 1 if x is not integer.
If (n-1)/m is integer, celing(n/m) = (n-1)/m + 1, equation holds.
So ceiling(n/m) <= (n-1)/m + 1

If n is negative decimal or m is less than 0.5, equation doesn't hold.
