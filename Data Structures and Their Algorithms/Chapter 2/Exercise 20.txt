Q.

Let T(n) be the running time of Puzzle(n). Find the order of T.

procedure Puzzle(integer n):
    for i from 1 to n do
        for j from 1 to 10 do
            for k from n to n + 5 do x <- x + 1

A.

For each (i,j), assignment is performed 5 times.

T(n) = sigma i from 1 to n (sigma j from 1 to 10 5)
     = sigma i from 1 to n 275
     = 275n
So lim n->inf |T(n)/n| = 275, which means that T ∈ Θ(n).
