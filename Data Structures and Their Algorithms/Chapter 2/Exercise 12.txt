Q.

This problem continues Problem 11 on algorithms for finding the greatest common divisor.
Define a smod b to be the integer r with the smallest absolute value such that a - r is divisible by b.
For example, 10 smod 3 = 1O mod 3 = 1, but 11 smod 3 = -1.
Show that if we replace "mod" with "smod" in Euclid's algorithm,
the algorithm still terminates and correctly computes the greatest common divisor.
Determine the running time of this modified Euclid's algorithm.

A.

function smod(integer a, b): integer
{Return smallest absolute value r such that a - r is divisible by b}
    r <- a
    while d > b do
        r <- r - b
    return r

function Euclid(integer a, b): integer
{Return greatest common divisor of positive integer a and b}
    a <- m
    b <- n
    while b != 0 do
        (a, b) <- (b, a smod b)
    return a

a smod b = r <=> (a-r_n) = b*k_n <=> r_n = a - b*k_n, so we can use smod to prove euclidean algorithm.

running time of this modified algorithm is the same as the original one.
