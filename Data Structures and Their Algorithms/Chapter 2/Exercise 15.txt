Q.

Let T(n) be the running time of Fum(n). Find the order of T (that is, find a function f(n) such that T ∈ Θ(f)).
(Assume that real arithmetic is carried out exactly, and is not subject to floating-point roundoff errors.)

procedure Fum(integer n):
    for i from 1 to n do
        d <- 1/i
        x <- i
        while x > 0 do
            x <- x - d

A.

For each i, assignment in while loop is performed i^2 times.
T(n) = sigma i from i to n i^2 = n(n+1)(2n+1)/6,
so lim n->inf |T/n^3| = 1/6, which means that T ∈ Θ(n^3).
