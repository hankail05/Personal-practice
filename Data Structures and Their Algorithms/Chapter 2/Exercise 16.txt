Q.

Let T(n) be the running time of Foo(n). Find the order of T.

procedure Foo(integer n):
    for i from 1 to n do
        x <- n
        while x > 0 do
            x <- x - i

A.

For each i, assignment in while loop performed i times.
T(n) = sigma i from 1 to n i = n(n+1)/2, so lim n->inf |T/n^2| = 1/2, which means that T ∈ Θ(n^2).
