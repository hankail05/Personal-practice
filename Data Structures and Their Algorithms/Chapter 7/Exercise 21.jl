Q.

As in the previous problem, suppose that a B-tree of order b grows
through addition of records only (no deletions). When the tree has n
items, what is the average number of times, per item, that nodes have
been split in two?

A.

Using a method in the previous problem, the average number of split is n/a * 3/4
