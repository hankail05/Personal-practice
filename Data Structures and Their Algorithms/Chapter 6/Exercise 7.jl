Q.

A linked representation, rather than a tabular representation, saves time when rearranging items if the Move-to-Front Heuristic is used. But it costs memory; how might the extra memory be better utilized by a different heuristic?

A.

In table, use Transpose Heuristic and extra memory for an temporary variable to swap elements.
