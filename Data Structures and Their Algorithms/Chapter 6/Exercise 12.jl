Q.

a. Write the insertion algorithm for a dictionary represented as an
ordered table, that is, the algorithm Insert(K, I, T[O. .n - 1]).
Assume that the maximum length of the table is given by the
constant N, and attempting to exceed this bound is an error condition.
Also assume that the current size of the table can be
changed simply by changing the value of n within the algorithm.
What is the order of the time complexity of your algorithm?

b. Under the same assumptions, write the algorithm for deleting an
item from a dictionary represented asan ordered table.

        error("Attempt to insert into full dict; abort")
