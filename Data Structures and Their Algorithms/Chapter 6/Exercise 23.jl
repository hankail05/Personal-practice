Q.

Give the exact formula that should replace the assignment to p in the
interpolation search algorithm (Algorithm 6.2 on page 185) in case the
LookUps are not uniformly distributed but the function F(K) gives
the probability that a LookUp is for a key value less than or equal
to K.

A.

p = (F(K) - F(T[left])) / (F(T[right]) - F(T[left]))
