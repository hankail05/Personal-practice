Q.

a. For each tree in Figure 6.5 on page 201, give a probability
distribution on the three keys for which that tree is optimal.

b. Suppose the probabilities of A, B, and C are p, 1 - 2p, and p,
where 0 < p < 1/2. For what value of p, if any, are trees (b), (c),
and (d) equally good?

A.

a.

p_A + p_B + p_C = 1

(a) => p_A > p_B * 2 > p_C * 3
(b) => p_A > p_C * 2 > p_B * 3
(c) => p_B < p_A / 2, p_B < p_C / 2
(d) => p_C > p_A * 2 > p_B * 3
(e) => p_C > p_B * 2 > p_A * 3

b.

(b) => p + 3(1-2p) + 2p = 3-3p
(c) => 2p + (1-2p) + 2p = 1+2p
(d) => 2p + 3(1-2p) + p = 3-3p

If p > 0.4 (c) is better, else (b) and (d) is better.
