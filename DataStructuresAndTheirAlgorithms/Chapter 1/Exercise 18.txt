Q.

Prove the Exponentials, Powers, and Logarithms Theorem.
(Hint: To show that any exponential function dominates any simple power,
let f(x) = c^x and g(x) = x^a, where c > 1 and a > 0. Apply L'Hopital's rule repeatedly)

A.

I guess it is asking about relation of them.

By definition, Exponentials ans Logarithms are inverse.

Derivative of c^x is c^x, and derivative of x^a is a*x^(a-1).
With L'Hopital's rule, lim x->inf c^x/x^a = lim x-> c^x/a! = inf, so c^x > x^a, where c > 1 and a > 0.

So O(c^x) > O(x^a) > O(log(x)).
