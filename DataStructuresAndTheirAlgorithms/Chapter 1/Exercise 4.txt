Q.

A Frob is an object that is available in three different sizes, and has
front, middle, and back parts, each of which (independently) can be
painted any of ten colors, or can be left unpainted.

a. Design a record structure with four fields that can be used for
representing Frobs. What is the minimum number of bits for
each field, and for the entire record structure?

b. It is possible to represent a Frob uniquely by using only 12 bits.
Explain how to encode the size and three color values to produce
the encoded representation of a Frob, and how to decode the
representation of a Frob to extract its size and three color values

A.

a.

To make each part painted any of ten color or not painted, we need at least 4 bits. To decide what size a Frob is, we need 2 bits.
A Frob needs at least 14 bits, so the minimum number of bits for each filed is 14, and for the entire record structure is 56.

b.

We can make 16 bit patterns with 4 bits, but we need only 11 bit patterns to decide what color it is.
If we choose one pattern (like 1110) and use one bit to decide a size (1111), we can represent a Frob with 12 bits.
Then, we can decode the representation of a Frob by taking four bits each.
