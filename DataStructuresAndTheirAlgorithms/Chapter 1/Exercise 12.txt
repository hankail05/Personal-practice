Q.

Under what conditions on the numbers x, y, and z does the relationship
floor(floor(x/y)/z) = floor(floor(x/z)/y) hold?
Under what circumstances is the left-hand side of this expression greater than the right-hand side?

A.

If x is real number and y, z are larger than or equal to 1, the equation holds.
If x is real number, z is larger than or equal to 1 and y is less than 1,
the left-hand side of this expression is greater than righ-hand side.
