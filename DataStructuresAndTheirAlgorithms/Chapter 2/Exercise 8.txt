Q.

Why does the clever multiplication algorithm switch to a nonrecursive
method to multiply integers of three or fewer bits?
What happens if line (1) is replaced by "if n < 2 ..."?

A.

If the clever multiplication uses recursive method when n = 3, P3 can have 3 bits, which causes furthur recursion.
if line (1) is placed by "if n < 2", the clever multiplication becomes taking twice time of gradeschoolmultiplication.
