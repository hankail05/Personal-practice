Q.

Let T(n) be the running time of Mystery(n). Find the order of T.

procedure Mystery(integer n):
    for i from 1 to n - 1 do
        for j from i + 1 to n do
            for k from 1 to j do x <- x + 1

A.

T(n) = sigma i from 1 to n-1 (sigma j from i+1 to n j)
     = sigma i from 1 to n-1 (n(n+1)/2 - (i(i+1)/2))
     = n^2(n-1)/2 - (n-1)n(2n-1)/12 - n(n-1)/4
So lim n->inf |T(n)/n^3| = 1/3, which means that T ∈ Θ(n^3).
